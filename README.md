## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Core Functionality
- `GET /` - Main dashboard
- `GET /upload` - PDF upload page
- `GET /trips` - Trip management interface
- `GET /shifts` - Shift management interface

### REST API
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload and process PDF files
- `GET /api/trips` - Retrieve all trips with essential information
- `GET /api/trips/<id>` - Get detailed trip information
- `POST /api/shifts` - Create shift from selected trips

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Simple & Flexible Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE schedule (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    trip_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stop_number INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    facility TEXT NOT NULL,
    arrive_time TEXT,
    depart_time TEXT,
    load_unload_duration TEXT,
    vehicle_type TEXT,
    vehicle_id TEXT,
    frequency TEXT,
    effective_date TEXT,
    expiration_date TEXT,
    nass_code TEXT,
    -- Contract information
    hcr_number TEXT,
    destination TEXT,
    supplier TEXT,
    -- Additional flexible fields for various PDF formats
    -- ... other columns as needed
);
```

### Key Design Principles
- **No Required Columns**: Missing data won't break imports
- **Flexible Data Types**: All columns are text/flexible for any PDF format
- **No Complex Constraints**: Simplified schema for maximum compatibility
- **Auto-creation**: Database created automatically on first upload

## 📋 Usage Guide

### 1. Upload PDF Schedule
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/upload
2. Select your trucking schedule PDF file
3. Click "Upload and Process"
4. Wait for extraction and database import to complete

### 2. View and Manage Trips
